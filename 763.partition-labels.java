 * Testcase Example:  '"ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"'
 *
 * 
 * A string S of lowercase letters is given.  We want to partition this string
 * into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one
 * part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
 * Output: [9,7,8]
 * Explanation:
 * The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
 * This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
 * A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it
 * splits S into less parts.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * S will have length in range [1, 500].
 * S will consist of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z') only.
 *
